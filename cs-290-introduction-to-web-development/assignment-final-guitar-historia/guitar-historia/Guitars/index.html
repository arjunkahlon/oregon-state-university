		   <h2>Gibson Les Paul</h2>
		   <img  src="../Images/Guitars/lespaul.jpg" class = "center">
		   <p>The Gibson Les Paul was first introduced to the world in 1952. The guitar was
           designed by former Gibson president, Ted McCarthy, with input from legendary
           guitar virtuoso, Les Paul. This was the first solid body guitar to be sold by
           Gibson. Once considered a failure, the Les Paul grew to become one of the most
           coveted and iconic instruments of the 20th and 21st centuries. From George Harrison of
           The Beatles and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin to Slash of Guns N' Roses, the Les
           Paul has become an icon of Rock music and has elevated Gibson to become one of America's
           most cherished brands. All Gibsons are manufactured in Nashville, Tennessee.

		   <p> When people hear the phrase electric guitar, they often visualize the Fender
		   	Stratocaster. Designed from 1952-1954 by Leo Fender, Bill Carson, George Fullerton,
		   	and Freddie Tavares, the Stratocaster has grown to become one of the most popular
		   	and iconic instruments thoughout the world. First made famous by the late Buddy Holly,
		   	the Stratocaster became synonomous with the world's most revered guitarist, Jimi Hendrix.
		   	The instrument is used in a variety of genres including Jazz, Blues, Country, Rock, Reggae,
		   	Punk, Heavy Metal. Notable guitarists who have used the Fender Stratocaster include Jimi

		   <h2>Paul Reed Smith Custom 24</h2>
		   <img  src="../Images/Guitars/custom24.jpg" class = "center">
		   <p>While the Fender Stratocaster and Gibson have become household names, there is a newcomer
		   	that has taken the guitar world by storm. Paul Reed Smith Guitars was founded in Stevensville
		   	Maryland by renowned luthier Paul Reed Smith in 1985. The Custom 24 was one of the first guitars
		   	PRS put on the market, and remains one of the brand's most popular guitars. This model features
		   	a mahogany back and neck and rosewood fingerboard decorated by bird shaped inlays which have
		   	become a defining design of the brand. The guitar features a pickup selector which allows it
		   	to imitate the single coil sound of the Fender Stratocaster as well as the humbucking sound
		   	of the Gibson Les Paul. Despite their struggles during the 2008 recession, PRS has recovered and
		   	have continued to grow their brand and reach guitarists throughout the world.
